## Solution
Moving the pieces of the puzzle to open the box, which reveals a QR-code that gives us the flag.

## Explanation
When I entered the room, there were alot of these wooden boxes around on tables, with chairs next to each of them.

First I started moving the pieces around randomly, not really having a goal in mind. After a while, I started thinking about how I didn't really know what I was looking for, and stopped for a moment to just look at the box.

Eventually I remembered there was a hint with the task;
"Hint: Try to figure out what squares move the lock hooks, and how the locking mechanism works, this will make the challenge easier."

After thinking about this, and trying to open the box a little, seeing some movement to the pieces in the bottom left corner, I figured I had to get the empty square down there.

Moving the pieces around, trying to get the open space to this area, I eventually got there. I kept trying to open the box, keeping the p√•en space in different places in that area. I then realised there was a hole at the far bottom of the left side, which made me try to keep it open there. 
I was now able to open the box.

In the box there was a QR-code that sent me to a site with the flag. Since I can't remember it, and the QR-code website is now down, I cannot retrieve the flag again.
