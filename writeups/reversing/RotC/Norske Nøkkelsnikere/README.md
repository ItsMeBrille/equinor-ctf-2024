## Description

This is a mini crackme where the program presents you with a string and then with the rotation amount. Trying to rotate, we see that it will rotate the first bit of the "obfuscated" flag and print it out.

Opening the binary up in binja, we can immediately see the string presented to us as well as the rotation amount it compares against.

A cipher which rotates like this is probably a `caesar cipher` and putting it into a solver with rotation on 19, we have our flag.
